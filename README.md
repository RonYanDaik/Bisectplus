# Bisectplus Add-on

Added options for separatoion of objects and loop cuts.

Bisect function called with a Plane object.

Bisect your object and get 3 vertex groups, the bisectionloop, FrontSide and BackSide respectively.
Now it's possible to let Bisectplus remember what selection you had before you well.. bisected.
Overriding the selection allows to easy ensure that there will be a bisection cut over the entire object, partwise is possible if you leave this unchecked and select only a certain area of the mesh.
All the functionality of the original bisect, aside from the gizmo and it's rather hard to control precision are also available.
Means now it's possible to do destructive bisections, while only mesh objects are accepted, cameras and lights are safe.




Use it for whatever purpose, provided you do not claim it as your own work and that you include a link to this site if redistributed.
